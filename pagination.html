        <p> Pagination is helpful when the website contains lots of content on a single page, and a single page will not look good with all those topics together. Few websites use the scroll to avoid pagination and vice versa. But the best looks come with the combination of scroll and pagination. As a developer, you can put a few contents on a page to make that page a little scrollable until itâ€™s annoying. After that, you can use pagination that will leave the previous content and proceed to the new content page but the topic will be the same.</p>
