        <h1> Hello </h1>
        <p>It's amazing what one notices, when one finds out their time for noticing is coming to an end. Like you have spent your entire life walking around with your eyes shaded by a translucent curtain, and then one day, they are reopened like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. I wonder if we ever truly see things, even as a child. Like a new born seeing its mother's breast for the first time. No, I don't think we ever really care to see anything for what it truly is, until our eyes are awakened by the foresight of never seeing anything again. </p>
