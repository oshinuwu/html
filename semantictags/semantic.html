            <aside> <h2>This is aside </h2>
            <p>The aside tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

                The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
                
                Tip: The aside content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
                
                Note: The aside element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the aside element (see example below).</p></aside>
            <section> <h2>This is section </h2>
                <p> The Section tag defines the section of documents such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections. The section tag divides the content into sections and subsections.

                    The section tag is used when requirements of two headers or footers or any other section of documents are needed. Section tag grouped the generic block of related contents. The main advantage of the section tag is, it is a semantic element, that describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>
           </section>
            <article> <h2>This is article </h2>
            <p> The article tag is independent of the other content of the page (even though it can be related).

                In other words, The article element represents a component of a page that consists of self-contained composition in a document, page, or site.</p> </article>
