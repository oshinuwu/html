        <pre>          Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
            The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
            But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
            If only you saw what I can see
            You'll understand why I want you so desperately
            Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
            That's what makes you beautiful</pre>
